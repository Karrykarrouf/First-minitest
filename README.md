This is bassically my first piece of code as a complete beginner. I wrote this code with less than a week of experience in programming, so be critical of my code.
I want to improve, so any advice is appreciated. Also, I am working hard on learning how to properly use makefiles (I am aware that the one in this project is lame),
any tips would be great. Finnally, I really want to learn how to use API's (setup/how to tackel documentation). Currently, I am trying to set up Opengl and it is really hard for
me to get libraries and such to work. That is all, have a great day ( ;
